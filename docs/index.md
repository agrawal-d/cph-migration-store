## About cph

cph is an extension for VS Code made to streamline your competitive programming
experience across several popular sites. It saves your time by auto-compiling,
running and judging your solutions. Using the 3rd party browser extension
'Competitive Companion', you can extend it's functionality by auto-downloaing
and parsing testcases from problem statements online.
